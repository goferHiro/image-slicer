# image-slicer
Split images into tiles. 

Perform advanced image processing in Go - slice images into tiles, combine the tiles.

## Idea and Inspiration

I was tasked with building a puzzle game in Go. I struggled to find an article or a library that can accomplish image slicing. 
Eventually, I  had to settle down with python's [image-slicer](https://pypi.org/project/image-slicer), and build a microservice 
[Game-Engine](https://github.com/pythoneerHiro/game-engine).

This incident made me realize that I can build a 35x faster library in Go. Hence, the inception of [image-slicer](https://github.com/goferHiro/image-slicer).

## Support


You can file an [Issue](https://github.com/goferHiro/image-slicer/issues/new).
See documentation in [Go.Dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/goferHiro/image-slicer?tab=doc)

## Getting Started

#### Download

```shell
go get -u github.com/goferHiro/image-slicer
```

# Example

### Slice Images

<details open>

<summary>Click to Expand</summary>

```go

imgUrl := "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/big-hero-6-fanon/images/0/0f/Hiro.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20180511180437"

img := imageslicer.GetImageFromUrl(imgUrl)

if img == nil {
log.Fatalln("invalid image url or image format not supported!")
}

grid := [2]uint{2, 2} //rows,columns

tiles := imageslicer.Slice(img, grid)

expectedTiles := int(grid[0] * grid[1])

if len(tiles) != expectedTiles {
log.Fatalf("expected %d rcvd %d\n", expectedTiles, len(tiles))
}

```

### Join the tiles back 

<details open>

<summary>Click to Expand</summary>

```go
//lets join the tiles back

joinedImg, err := imageslicer.Join(tiles, grid)

if err != nil {
log.Fatalf("joining tiles failed due to %s", err)
}

shapeJ := joinedImg.Bounds()
shapeI := img.Bounds()

fmt.Println(shapeJ, shapeI) //shape might change due to pixel loss
}

```

### Get Images 

```go
//From base64

base64str := "" //very long.

img, err := imageslicer.GetImageFromBase64(base64str)


//From urls

imgUrl := "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/big-hero-6-fanon/images/0/0f/Hiro.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20180511180437"

img := imageslicer.GetImageFromUrl(imgUrl)


```

## Important Notes/Caveats/Pitfalls

- Use the latest release.
- ```go Slice(img,grid)```
    - ensure grid[0]*grid[1]>0.
    - ensure img is not nil.
    - its best if the img is downsized to the area of grid to avoid pixel losses. //Will bring support in future releases
- ```go Join(tiles,grid)```
    - ensure that the grid is the same grid used originally for slicing.
    - the grid is utilized to figure out positions of tiles & the dimensions of the final image.
    - For best results, ensure the tiles were generated by [image-slicer](https://github.com/goferHiro/image-slicer).
- ```go GetImageFromBase64(base64str) ```
    - Supports the image tag format i.e "data:image/jpeg;base64,/" as well
    - Supports jpeg,png only
    - Does not support svg, or any other formats
- ```go GetImageFromUrl(imgUrl) ```
    - Expects jpeg,png formats only
